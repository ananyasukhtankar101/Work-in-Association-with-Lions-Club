# 'Relieve the Hunger' Project : Lions Club 
The Lions Club of Ghatkopar established in 1958 stands as a Beacon of Service in Lions International-District 3231A2, rendering continuous services to the community. As showcased on their official website: The services by Lions Club fanned out to Medical Checkup Camps, Eye Sight Camp, Cataract Operations, Artificial Limbs to Handicapped, Yoga Center, Blood Bank, Book Bank, Education Aid, Literacy Center, Library, Etc. The Club also extended on constructing permanent Monumental Project for City Developments such as Community Hall, Gardens, Fountains, Bus-Stop Shelters, Drinking Water, Old-age Homes, Hospitals, Diagnostic Center, Clinics and so on. 
I am honoured to have been actively involved in their 'Relieve the Hunger' project which included the team preparing food from available raw materials and then distributing it to the ones in need. The drive was conducted every Sunday at 6:30am at Lions Community Hall.
